#summary List of capabilities for the AeroQuad Shield v2.0 for the Arduino Mega

= !AeroQuad Shield v2.0 Capabilities =
Exact channel quantities are TBD until board design is complete.  Stated numbers are starting quantities.

== External Pilot Commands ==
 * I2C commands received from external daughter board
 * Serial commands received through TX0/RX0 (generated from the Configurator or your own custom program)
 * PPM input on pin 49
== Inertial Measurement Unit ==
 * 6DOF Inertial Measurement Unit constructed of either the
  * Sparkfun 5DOF IMU and IXZ500 Yaw gyro
  * Sparkfun IMU 6DOF Razor
== Motor Control ==
 * 11 non-powered servo style outputs to drive external ESC's using PWM
   * power will be routed to servo outputs
 * Screw down terminals for driving I2C ESC's
== Servo Control ==
 * Used for camera stabilization and/or tilt, motor tilt or any other deployment
 * ~16 powered servo style outputs powered from Motor Control ESC's
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 1
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 2
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 3
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 4
 * still need to decide how to provide power to servos if I2C used
== Additional Sensors ==
 * Magnetometer input from HMC5843 via I2C
 * Barometer input from SCP1000 via SPI
 * 4 Proximity sensors using analog input channels (servo style connector)
 * GPS connections for 5V or 3.3V and TX1/RX1
 * Video On Screen Display using MAX7456 via SPI
 * !AttoPilot Voltage and Current Sense using an analog input channel (servo style connector)
 * Voltage divider for battery monitor
== Customizable light pattern ==
 * Darlington array drivers for quantity 7 12V LED strips (power directly from external 12V lipo)
== Utilities ==
 * Reset button
 * Ready LED (connected to DIO 13)
