#summary List of capabilities for the AeroQuad Shield v2.0 for the Arduino Mega

= !AeroQuad Shield v2.0 Capabilities =
Exact channel quantities are TBD until board design is complete.  Stated numbers are starting quantities.

== Inertial Measurement Unit ==
 * 6DOF Inertial Measurement Unit constructed of either the
  * Sparkfun 5DOF IMU and IXZ500 Yaw gyro
  * Sparkfun IMU 6DOF Razor
== Motor Control ==
 * 11 non-powered servo style outputs to drive external ESC's using PWM
   * power will be routed to servo outputs
 * Screw down terminals for driving I2C ESC's
== Servo Control ==
 * ~16 powered servo style outputs powered from Motor Control ESC's
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 1
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 2
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 3
  * 4 servos powered from motor output 4
 * still need to decide how to provide power to servos if I2C used
